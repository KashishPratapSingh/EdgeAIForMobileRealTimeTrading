Edge AI for Mobile Real-Time Trading Execution and Risk Assessment
Project Overview
This project implements a mobile trading application that uses on-device Edge AI to perform real-time trading decisions and risk assessment. The system runs TensorFlow Lite models directly on smartphones, enabling ultra-low latency decisions, privacy preservation, and offline-capable risk assessment.

Features
Ultra-Low Latency: Sub-100ms AI decision making on mobile devices
Privacy-Preserving: All AI computations run locally on the device
Offline Capable: Risk assessment continues during poor connectivity
Explainable AI: Trade recommendations with detailed explanations
Real-Time Processing: WebSocket-based market data streaming
Location-Aware: Optional GPS-based context for trading strategies
